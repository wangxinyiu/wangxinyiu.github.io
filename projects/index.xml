Ultimately, I opted for Step Functions for implementation and carried out the system design accordingly. Decoupled the original code into smaller units and transitioned from Python to Java.

      <description>What I did Deomo: https://recordit.co/cXdWcj0ahV&#xA;Designed and built a single-page web application using React. Bootstrap the development with mature component library Ant Design. Implemented the backend services based on Spring Boot to support stay upload, delete, search, and reserve functionality. Used MySQL to store user-generated data, e.g. stay information and reservation history, and utilized Google Cloud Storage to store media files for uploaded stays. Created geo index by Elasticsearch to support geo-based stay search based on user’s selected locations.</description>
